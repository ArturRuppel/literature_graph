"""The viewer ships as one self-contained file assembled from viewer/css/ + viewer/js/.

The split is a source split only: `lit build`'s output must stay a single page with no
external requests, because it opens from file:// and from a phone with no network. These
tests guard the seam between the modules and that one-file contract.
