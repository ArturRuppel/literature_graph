// The band is FLAT: every rung of every ladder has a card, always. It was not always — the band
// used to land on its ROOTS only, and a rung appeared when the human showed the node above it, on
// the theory that 42 nodes at once is a backlog and 14 is a view. Hiding was the wrong tool for
// that job. Once ORDER does the organizing, hiding only subtracts: you cannot see that a claim you
// have not clicked exists, cannot read the shape of the ladder without walking it, and a claim
// reachable through two parents flickers in and out depending on which one you have open.
//
// So `shownBroad` means one thing only: whose block is gathered at the top (and whose papers are in
// the column). Nothing about it decides what exists on screen. That still holds — the band is now
// CONTAINERIZED rather than flat (see broadFamilies), and containment reveals nothing and hides
// nothing; it only puts a family in one box instead of spraying it across four columns.

// ── the band as containers ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The band used to be four COLUMNS keyed by altitude — `broadLevel` returned SYNTH+tier and each
// rung stood in the column its tier put it in. Altitude is a derived scalar; `leads_to` between two
// broad nodes is the relation actually authored, and rendering the scalar instead of the relation
// sprayed every family across the board: tier 0 alone held 34 of 45 cards, and the only thing
// tying a parent to its children was an arrow `redraw` deliberately suppresses until the node is
// hovered or clicked. At rest the ladder was not drawn at all.
//
// So a family is a CONTAINER, the same way a paper is a container of its slices (CONCEPT: the model
// is recursively containerized). Containment is drawn as containment — a box inside a box — which
// is why the rung arrows are gone rather than merely dimmed: geometry says what the arrow said, and
// says it without being hovered. One synthesis column now, one card per ladder root, everything
// under that root nested inside it.
//
// There is therefore no `broadLevel` any more: every broad card's id is `card-<SYNTH>:<slug>`
// whatever its altitude, so every id-building call site (expandCard, hoistEls, showBroad, the pin
// derivation) is unchanged — the card moved in the DOM, not in the addressing scheme.
const synthLabel=()=>"synthesis →";

// A node with two parents cannot nest under both without being duplicated, and duplication is
// precisely what `localDag` was written to stop doing to the paper card. So: a node NESTS under the
// first parent its authored `leads_to` names, and every other parent gets a REFERENCE row pointing
// at the real card. Authored order means the curator decides which parent hosts, with no magic to
// reverse-engineer. Three nodes today, one of which (vimentin-effect-is-context-dependent) is the
// only one whose parents sit under different roots.
