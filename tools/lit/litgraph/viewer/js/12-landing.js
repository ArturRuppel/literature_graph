// ── boot: the landing list (column 0), ranked by pass desc, then year desc ───────────────
// The landing column lists CURATED papers only. ORDER carries the whole bibliography (~3.7k
// entries against 54 curated ones), and rendering a card for each built a ~187k-px column whose
// mere existence taxed every forced relayout — one per click, one per hover. Measured at 4x CPU
// throttle, trimming it cut a click from 34.8 ms to 13.6 ms and rebuild() from 23.2 to 10.2 ms.
//
// Nothing becomes unreachable. Stubs stay indexed by the search box, which materializes a landing
// card on demand (gotoPaper), and the two ways a stub is drawn *into* the graph both still work:
// uncurated grounds fold into the per-card source stack (they never had a landing card of their
// own to anchor on), and a lateral/answers target that is only a stub is materialized up front by
// landingKeys so its arrow still lands.

    for(const f of ["lateral","ans"])

}

// ── the flat landing column ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every curated paper, always, in ORDER's pass ranking — the same decision as the synthesis band,
// for the same reason. This column was collapsed for a while: it landed empty and papers arrived
// only when something asked for them (a claim you showed, a jump by name), on the theory that a
// list of 54 you must scroll is a backlog rather than a view. It is a backlog only if scrolling is
// the sole way to reach anything in it. It isn't — showing a claim HOISTS its papers to the top of
// this column, so the reader's attention is placed by order, and the collapse was buying nothing
// the hoist did not already deliver while costing everything below:
//
//   · a card could be *put away*, so what the column held became session history rather than a
//     fact about the library, and three doors in needed a per-card × and a `clear` to undo;
//   · a paper's presence had to be EXPLAINED (the `.cprov` strip exists for this), because the
//     reader could not otherwise know why these 12 and not the other 42;
//   · the board could not answer "what have I curated?" at all without opening the library.
//
// What survives is one door and one set of state:
//   landedStuck — a paper named by the search box or a library row that the flat list does NOT
//                 carry, i.e. a STUB. Curated papers are always present, so naming one is a
//                 scroll-and-flash (gotoPaper) and adding it here is a no-op. Sticky, because
//                 naming something is a standing request; `clear` is the way back.
//   shownBroad  — the claims you have SHOWN (showBroad). No longer decides which papers EXIST in
//                 the column, only which ones are gathered at its top, and which arrows are lit.
// `landedDropped` and the per-card × went with the collapse: hiding a paper from a flat list is
// the very thing the flat list is for not doing.
const landedStuck=new Set();

// ── the way out ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// TWO DOORS, nested, sharing one implementation so they cannot disagree:
//
//   clear arrows (HUD, `c`)      every pinned row + every shown claim + the hover. The edge layer
//                                goes quiet and the board stands still — nothing closes, nothing
//                                re-sorts, no card moves.
//   clear (landing column head)  the above, plus the stubs you summoned by name. A summoned stub
//                                is a search result, not an arrow, which is the whole difference.
//
// The HUD door is new, and it is the fix for the report that opening and collapsing a run of
// claims leaves the board full of arrows with no way back. Before it, releasing depended on
// finding the thing you had pinned: click the same row again (impossible once its card is
// collapsed — and see pinLive for the stale-pin half of that bug), or click empty board space
// (there is none once four columns have fanned out, and it thawed row pins only, never a shown
// claim), or scroll to the top of the landing column for a `clear` that did the exact opposite —
// claims but not rows. Three partial exits, none reachable from the mess they made.
//
// It is deliberately NOT bound to Escape: Escape already closes the library, the walk, the views
// menu and the search box, and a fifth listener that fires unconditionally would clear the board
// behind whichever pane you were actually dismissing.

// ── showing a claim: ONE gesture ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This used to be three. A ◂ chip landed the claim's papers in the column; a ▸ chip walked one rung
// down the ladder; a click on the card pinned its edges bright and hoisted the block. They read as
// alternatives and were not: since the landing column collapsed, a pin has nothing to light up
// until its evidence has landed, so the card click was only ever the chips' other half — and which
// of the three you reached for changed what you got.
//
// Now the card is the whole gesture, at every altitude. Click a claim: whatever sits one step below
// it joins it at the top of the board — its papers land in the column, the narrower claims that
// ladder into it are hoisted up beside it on the band, its arrows go bright and stay bright, and
// the whole block gathers into one screenful. Click again: it all comes undone. Which kind of
// evidence a claim has is a fact about the graph; making the reader express it as a different
// gesture pushed a detail of the schema into the hands. The chips are readouts of that state, not
// ways to enter part of it.
//
// The gesture PLACES; it no longer reveals. The rungs used to appear on this click (see broadTier for
// why they stopped hiding), so a claim's own subtree could vanish under it and `pruneShown` existed to
// keep that consistent. With the band flat, showing a claim can only ever move things.
