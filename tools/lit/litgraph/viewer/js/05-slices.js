// ── the paper's local subgraph ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A paper's slices form a small DAG — measured across the 53 curated papers it is never
// deeper than 5 nor wider than 12 — and this reduces it to a drawing order for that DAG.
//
// Direction: `a` stands ABOVE `b` when a rests on b (grounded_in), when a is the broader
// claim b ladders into (local leads_to), or when a is the question b answers. So the top of
// the list is what the paper concluded and the bottom is the floors it stands on, which is
// the order the outline used to nest in — minus the nesting.
//
//   * `rows`  — every slice exactly once, each below all of its parents (Kahn, depth-first
//     so a chain stays contiguous, ties broken by authored order).
//   * `depth` — longest path from a root, the indent. Reproduces the outline's shape for the
//     tree-like part without paying its duplication for the parts that aren't a tree.
//   * `links` — the real edges, drawn as arcs. This is the half an outline threw away: a
//     support with two parents, and a claim that grounds in something three generations down.
