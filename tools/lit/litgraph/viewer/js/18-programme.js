// ── the narrative card: a proposal's prose, wired into the graph ─────────────────────────
// A narrative (programme design §7, extended) is one linearization of the programme into a
// grant's sections. It used to render as a static panel in a standing "programme lane" on the
// main board, with each bullet's citations as inert chips. Two things were wrong with that:
//
//   * **the lane.** A grant's argument stood in the leftmost column of every reader's board,
//     whether they had come to read the proposal or to browse the library. The programme is
//     something you ASK for now — the HUD's programme pill opens one aim, or a whole proposal
//     (narrative + the aims under it), on its own page. Nothing programme-shaped is on the
//     board at rest; `order` is paper-only, so nothing puts one there.
//   * **the chips.** A bullet's refs are the one thing a reader wants to follow, and a chip is
//     a dead end exactly where the rest of this viewer draws an arrow. The old comment here
//     defended that as protecting the schema — but the schema is protected by the narrative
//     carrying no edges *into the graph*, which is a fact about build.py, not about what the
//     viewer is allowed to draw. So a bullet is now a slice and its refs are ordinary `grounds`
//     / `cons` edges (build._narrative_card_json), and this card gets the whole machinery for
//     free: open it, and every sentence has arrows running to the cards it rests on; hover one
//     and just its sources light up.
//
// Deleting programme/narrative/ still changes nothing the graph computes — that invariant is
// held where it always was, in the Python (tests/test_narrative.py), not by refusing to draw.

// The narrative's own rendering of its slices, in place of the paper DAG (renderGraph) and the
// aim outline. Neither fits: a bullet has no local support and no sub-structure — the ONLY
// structure a narrative has is which section a sentence stands in, and that is an ordering, not
// a graph. So the sections are the groups, in the order the file writes them, and a bullet is a
// leaf row whose whole content is the sentence that will appear in the grant.
