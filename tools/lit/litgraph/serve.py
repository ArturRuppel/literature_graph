# litgraph/serve.py
"""`lit serve`: the viewer over HTTP — live rebuild + PDF preview/open.

`lit build` emits a self-contained file for sharing; serving adds the two things a static
file can't do. (1) Every page load re-reads the data repo's YAML and rebuilds the graph,
so refresh-after-edit is the curation loop — an edit that breaks validation returns the
BuildError as a 500 (the server survives; fix the YAML and refresh). (2) The curated PDFs
(`<citekey>.pdf` in `pdf_dir`) are exposed as `pdfs.json` (which citekeys have one),
`/pdf/<citekey>.pdf` (the file) and `/preview/<citekey>.png` (its first page rendered
server-side — an <img> previews everywhere, unlike embedding a PDF), which the viewer
tooltip upgrades on: hover previews the paper, click opens it. A loopback convenience
for one curator, not a deployment server.

Serving pages to a phone is a bandwidth problem, so three things are negotiated rather than
fixed. `/page/<citekey>/<n>.<png|jpg>?w=` lets the client name the width it will actually paint
(snapped to a `pdfview.WIDTHS` rung) and pick JPEG, which together cut a page from ~1.1 MB to
~165 KB; every PDF-derived body carries an mtime-keyed ETag so a revisit costs a bodiless 304
instead of the whole document again; and text bodies gzip on demand, which matters most for the
~2 MB graph page itself. Omitting `?w=` and asking for `.png` reproduces the old behaviour
exactly, so a static `lit build` artifact and any cached older viewer keep working."""
