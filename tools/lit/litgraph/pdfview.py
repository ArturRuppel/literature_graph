"""Socket-free PDF page rendering for the viewer's quote windows.

Shared by ``lit serve`` (:mod:`litgraph.serve`) and the electronic-lab-notebook plugin
(``litgraph_eln``) so the two serving layers render identically and can't drift — the drift
that once left the plugin without a ``/page`` route, so the quote window rendered nothing.
Pure functions over a PDF path, each with an mtime-keyed module cache; no server object, no
HTTP. The HTTP layers own only validation, routing, and caching headers.

# this" — but must agree on what *counts* as a match, or a quote would land where a search says
# there is nothing.
