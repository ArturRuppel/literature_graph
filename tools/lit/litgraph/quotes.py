"""Quote polishing for display + integrity flagging (SCHEMA §6.4).

The stored `quote` is the *tight verbatim anchor* a curator welds to the paper's `.md`.
For the viewer we derive a `quote_display`: the anchor grown out to its enclosing
sentence(s) and stripped of citation / figure-callout artifacts. Nothing here mutates the
YAML — the anchor stays exactly as authored, and if the stripper improves, every quote
upgrades on the next build with no data migration.

Two tiers, exactly as SCHEMA §6.4 anticipates:
  * a plain anchor is located verbatim in the `.md`, expanded, stripped  -> status "verbatim"
  * an authored `[...]` join is non-contiguous by construction, so it is polished
    segment-by-segment (each segment located/stripped) and flagged  -> status "joined"
A quote that can't be located at all is stripped-only and flagged  -> status "not_found".

Stripping is deliberately conservative: a parenthetical is deleted only when it reads as a
citation (a Capitalized name followed by a year, nothing but name/year/punctuation inside),
so content parentheticals — (N = 16), (CeNuS), (tumor diameter, tumor grade, ...) — survive.
Clause-level trimming ("as illustrated in Fig. 3") is a curator judgement, authored via the
`[...]` join; it is never done automatically.
