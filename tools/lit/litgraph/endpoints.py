# litgraph/endpoints.py
"""What the two viewer servers actually share — no HTTP framework, either way.

`lit serve` (stdlib `http.server`) and the labbook's Flask plugin expose the same viewer
over the same data. They already share the validation regexes and `locate_quote`; what they
kept re-implementing was the two things below, and both had drifted:

  * **the payload.** Each grew its own `_payload_dict`. `lit serve`'s learned `views` and
    `include_aims` (and, while the curation cockpit was still current, a `cockpit` flag —
    retired along with it, see CURATION.md); the plugin's did not, so the labbook served a
    viewer that was quietly a version behind. One function now, with the serve-only extras
    as arguments that default to off — a static `lit build` artifact still never sees them.
  * **the PDF guard.** "validate the citekey, find the file, run a pdfview function, turn
    any failure into a 404" appeared six times in the plugin and six more in `lit serve`,
    written slightly differently each time.

Nothing here imports Flask or `http.server`: failures raise `HttpError`, and each adapter
decides how to write a status and a body. That is the whole seam — it keeps this module
testable without a socket, which is how the plugin gets test coverage at all."""

    May raise `BuildError`: a repo mid-edit is a normal state, and both servers turn that

    polished against the `.md` full text in `pdf_dir` (falling back to the raw anchor when a
    paper has no `.md`), and `[curation] active` is re-read per call, so editing it is live —
    it is now a plain reading list (CURATION.md), not a curation-session worklist.

    `views` and `include_aims` are serve-only: a `lit build` artifact has no server to answer
